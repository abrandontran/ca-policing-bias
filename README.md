This project uses the Stanford Open Policing Project to investigate the relationship between race and police searches of vehicles in United States arrest data. We look at variables that are not included in the final scatterplots of the Stanford project to gauge whether reason for pulling drivers over were often serious enough to warrant searches. We also alternate the statistics used by the statisticians in the project for the threshold test and observe any trends resulting from the alternate statistics.
