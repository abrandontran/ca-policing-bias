## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
datasf <- url('https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:hp256wp2687/hp256wp2687_ca_san_francisco_2019_08_13.rds')
testSF <- readRDS(file = data)
```
```{r}
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) #turning off the R feature that turns the data into strings

path <- "https://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json?lat=36.7201600&lng=-4.4203400"
request <- GET(url = path, 
               query = list(
                 lat = 53.421813,
                 lng = -2.330251,
                 date = "2018-05")
               )

response <- content(request, as = "text", encoding = "UTF-8")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
